# Pet face detector

Project based on official tutorial on Tensorflow Object Detection API.


Repo contains:
1. Google Colab notebook (model training and inference).
2. Model .config file.
3. Some demo with my cat's face detection ('output' folder).


### Model:
1. Base network - Faster R-CNN (Resnet101) pretrained on COCO.
2. Transfer learning is performed on Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/).


### NB:
Model is not included due to its size, data can be found on the Internet (link was provided upper).
